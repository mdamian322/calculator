# Calculator App for QA Testing

Welcome! This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
With that it comes with the [Jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/) built in. We will be using that to practice unit testing. For automated testing we will be using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) which was added. 

## Setup
1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your computer. You can download that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and make sure to select the right one for Windows or Mac.
2. Clone the project to your computer. I would do this in the folder where you are putting your Tech Moms projects, so make sure you have `cd`d into that before running this.
```
git clone https://github.com/mdamian322/calculator.git
```
3. Run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies needed for this project like Cypress, etc.


## Scripts for developing

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make changes.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner to run all the unit tests in the `__tests__` folder

### `yarn run cypress`

Launches Cypress so you can run the automated tests


## Challenge: Add additional tests for Calculator
I would love for you to add additional tests for practice! Feel free to make a Pull Request (PR) with any tests you add and I'll be more than happy to take a look or answer any questions! 

To make a Pull Request:
1. Make a new branch off of `main` by doing `git checkout -b your_name_branch`. This just makes a new branch that is a copy of `main`. Make sure you do `git pull` before doing this to make sure you have the most recent changes from `main`.
2. Make your changes and then commit them to your branch.
- This adds all of the files you changed to be saved/commited
```
git add -A
```
 -  This saves/commits your changes to the files so you don't loose them locally with your message being in the ""
 ```
git commit -m "added tests"
```
3. Push your changes so they show up [here](https://github.com/mdamian322/calculator/pulls) under pull requests
```
git push
```
